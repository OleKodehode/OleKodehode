## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ole**  from Norway.  
I officially started my programming journey in 2024 by trying to teach myself Python, and later transitioned to learning more web development related languages and concept through Jobloop's Kodehode in 2025/2026, and this is the Github account we made in conjuction with the course.  


But even though I waited a while with starting my programming journey, I've had stints of dipping my feet into it before, and I've always been curious about how electronics work in general.  


#### What we were taught through Kodehode's front-end module
