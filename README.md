## Hi there 👋

I'm **Ole**  from Norway.  
I officially started my programming journey in 2024 by trying to teach myself Python, and later transitioned to learning more web development related languages and concept through [Jobloop](https://www.jobloop.no)'s [Kodehode](https://www.kodehode.no) in 2025/2026, and this is the Github account we made in conjuction with the course.  


But even though I waited a while with starting my programming journey, I've had stints of dipping my feet into it before, and I've always been curious about how electronics work in general.  


### What we were taught through Kodehode's web developer course

### Learned on my own

I started my journey around June/July 2024, spending my time on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).  
While I didn't find the front-end stuff that fun to learn, I found myself drawn to Python (and to a degree back-end) when I reached that part.  
While I haven't done much in Python since I started in Kodehode, I feel like it was a good foundation to have before entering Kodehode's course/bootcamp, and probably would be excited to work more with Python in the future
